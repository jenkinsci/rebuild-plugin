TODO:

DONE remove config options from job config screen

DONE enable "auto rebuilding"

change icon

DONE create pipeline DSL to use with plugin

create the other side of promote, a global promote object
 - should contain things like the commit hash to build
 - the last promoted hash or build number
 - the last promoted version number
 - maybe version number should be a real object with properties like major, minor, patch etc

can we get changelogs?
