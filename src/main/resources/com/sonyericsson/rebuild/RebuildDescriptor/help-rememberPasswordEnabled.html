    If the remember password option is checked, the rebuild plugin will use the stored password parameter when a
    rebuild is triggered. If the remember password option is unchecked, the user will be prompted to enter the
    password every time a rebuild is triggered. This only applies for a parameterized build with parameters of
    type password.
